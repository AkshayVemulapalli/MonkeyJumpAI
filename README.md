# MonkeyJumpAI: A Genetic Algorithm-based Game AI

## Project Overview

**MonkeyJumpAI** is a project that showcases the creation of a machine learning model that utilizes genetic algorithms to master a game inspired by the popular Doodle Jump. Unlike typical approaches, MonkeyJumpAI was built entirely from scratch, leveraging no pre-existing machine learning libraries. This hands-on method allowed for a deeper understanding and customization of the genetic algorithm.

The core objective was to design an AI that could not only learn to play the game but also excel at it, achieving levels of performance comparable to skilled human players, yet at significantly higher speeds. Remarkably, after 50 generations of evolution, the AI demonstrated an impressive ability to compete with human skill levels, offering insights into the potential of genetic algorithms in gaming AI.

This project was brought to life using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), a popular set of Python modules designed for writing video games, which facilitated the creation of a dynamic and interactive game environment for the AI to navigate.

## Features

- **Custom Genetic Algorithm**: Developed from scratch to evolve AI performance over generations.
- **Performance**: Achieves human-like skill levels at increased speeds after 50 generations.
